# How to play Pong

The game pong is quite simple, you use your paddle to get the ball to the other side, if the opponent fails to touch the ball and it passes their paddle, you score a point. This goes both ways, if you fail to touch the ball back to the opponents side they score a point.

The controls for the game pong are:
* W & S for the left paddle (player 1)
* ArrowUp & ArrowDown for the right paddle (player 2)
* Escape to open the pause screen to catch a break and how to play the game.
